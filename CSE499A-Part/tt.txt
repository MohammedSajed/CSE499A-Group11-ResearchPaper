// about dataset
This dataset was collected using the official facebook app and it is about circles or friends list from facebook.

The collected data was replaced with anonymous value for each user id. 
For example, it helped to find whether 2 people contain the same value against a particular feature of the feature vectors from the dataset but not their personal affiliation with a feature

Learning to Discover Social Circles in Ego Networks NIPS, 2012 by J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. 

There is no good way of processing our personal large and cluttered social network data. Users are allowed to manually catagorize their friends into different social circles (circles on google, list on facebook and tweeter). identification of users' social circle networks is posed as a node clustering problem on a user's ego network, with a list of his/her friends. then we build a model for detecting circles and each circle learn its members and circle-specific user. Overlapping detection is possible through node membership to multiple circles. The model worked well on our test stages on different dataset.
